# SFGame Scrapbook Helper
A Chrome scrapbook helper extension for Shakes & Fidget. Useful if you don't have the holy grail yet.

It works purely by scanning http requests, making it virtually undetectable.

## How to use
1. Install the extension.
2. Open your scrapbook so the tool can scan it.
3. Browse players in hall of fame and the tool will show you how many of their items you're missing. 
Note that you will have to wait awhile before scanning the same player repeatedly as SFGame seems to cache the inventories.
